        <h1 class="sec01">How Did We Do This?</h1>
        <p>The creation of SignBridge was driven by our commitment to fostering inclusivity and enhancing communication in the academic field for both the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Our team leveraged state-of-the-art technologies and collaborated with experts in sign language interpretation and assistive technology to develop a seamless and reliable platform.</p>

        <h1 class="sec01">Key Features</h1>
        <p>SignBridge stands out with its unique real-time sign language to speech conversion. Unlike traditional text-to-speech systems, our application can be used in real-time with a camera, allowing deaf students to communicate with professors while moving around.

Additionally, our application generates notes from the professor's audio, ensuring that students can keep detailed records of lectures and discussions.</p>
