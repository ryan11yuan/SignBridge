SignBridge is an innovative application designed to enhance communication and accessibility in academic environments for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Leveraging cutting-edge real-time sign language to speech conversion, SignBridge allows students to communicate with professors using a camera, providing unparalleled mobility and immediacy. This functionality ensures that students can engage in dynamic, moving interactions without being confined to static text-to-speech systems. Furthermore, SignBridge offers an additional feature that generates detailed notes from the professor's audio, helping students maintain comprehensive records of lectures and discussions. This combination of real-time communication and automatic note-taking makes SignBridge a powerful tool for fostering inclusive and efficient learning experiences.
